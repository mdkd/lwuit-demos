The Birthdays application provides a simple overview of all the upcoming birthdays of the contacts stored in your phone book.

== List view

The List view shows a list of upcoming birthdays, as of today. The birthdays are sorted so that on the top of the list are the birthdays that will occur next, while the birthdays that have recently passed are at the bottom of the list.

If there are no birthdays associated with contacts in the phone, an empty list with a hint item will be displayed:

For each item in the list, the following info is displayed:
- contact name ("John Doe")
- age on upcoming birthday ("62")
- date of birth ("Oct 10 1951")
- pretty-printed time until the birthday ("tomorrow")

== Contact selection view

When the user chooses to add a new Birthday, the application checks if there are contacts in the phonebook that do not have a birthday assigned. If so, the selection view is shown to allow the user to choose a Contact for whom to assign a birthday. The user may also choose to create a new contact, in which case a new contact will be created as a contact in the phone with the chosen birthday.

== Birthday creation view

The Create view allows you to add a new birthday by entering a name and a date of birth. Depending on how the user chose previously in the Contact selection view, selecting Save in this view might either update an existing contact, or create a new Contact item in the phonebook.
